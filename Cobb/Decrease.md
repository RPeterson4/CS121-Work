What if the firm had this production function?

<center> $Y=AL^{.2}K^{.7}$ </center>

while its budget constraint was still the same:

<center> $pL + qK = 600$</center>

Here, $B+a<1$ (i.e., $.2 + .7 = .9$), signifying that the production function has decreasing returns to scale. That is, doubling the usage of labor and capital will less than double total production.

How does this plot compare to the past two?
