Let's generalize the production function from the last example:

<center> $Y=AL^{.25}K^{.75}$ </center>

whereby the budget constraint is given as:

<center> $pL + qK = 600$</center>

Note that $B+a=1$ (i.e., $.25 + .75 = 1$), signifying that the production function has constant returns to scale. That is, doubling the usage of labor and capital will double total production.

The app takes values for a range of $A$, total factor productivity, $p$, the price of labor, and $q$, the price of capital. As these values change, how does the optimal amount of labor and capital change? What about total production? Note that the contours represent total production, the blue line represents the budget constraint, and the red dot represents the labor and capital necessary to optimize production.
