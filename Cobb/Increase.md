What if the firm's production function was instead:

<center> $Y=AL^{.3}K^{.8}$ </center>

while its budget constraint was still the same:

<center> $pL + qK = 600$</center>

Here, $B+a>1$ (i.e., $.3 + .8 = 1.1$), signifying that the production function has increasing returns to scale. That is, doubling the usage of labor and capital will more than double total production.

How does this plot compare to the past one?
