Firms often intend to maximize production from a limited amount of labor and capital.
A Cobb-Douglas production function can help find the optimal amount of labor and capital necessary to maximize production:

<center> $Y=AL^BK^a$ </center>

whereby: 

<center> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $Y$ = total production
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $L$ = the labor used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $K$ = the capital used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $A$ = total factor productivity

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $B$ = output elasticity of labor (i.e., the productivity of labor)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $a$ = output elasticity of capital (i.e., the productivity of capital) </center>

However, firms also often have budget constraints on the use of labor and capital, such as:

<center> $pL + qK = C$</center>

whereby:

<center> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $p$ = the price of labor 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $q$ = the price of capital
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $C$ = the budget of the firm
</center>

Consider a firm whose production function is given by:

<center> $Y=6L^{.25}K^{.75}$ </center>

and whose budget constraint is given by:

<center> $5L + 4K = 600$</center>

How can Lagrange multipliers find the optimal capital and labor necessary to maximize production for this firm?

We are interested in computing $gradY=\lambda gradC$. We'll need to compare $Y_L$ to $C_L$ and $Y_K$ to $C_K$ for both equations:

<center> $Y_L = \lambda C_L$

$1.5L^{-.75}K^{.75}=5\lambda$

$Y_K = \lambda C_K$

$4.5L^{.25}K^{-.25}=4\lambda$
</center>

Solving for lambda and setting the two equations equal to each other gives:

<center> $\frac{1.5L^{-.75}K^{.75}}{5}=\frac{4.5L^{.25}K^{-.25}}{4}$ </center>

By simplifying and rearranging the equation we can solve for capital in terms of labor:

<center> $K=3.75L$ </center>

Then we substitute $K$ in terms of labor back into our budget constraint and solve for $L$:

<center> $5L + 4(3.75L) = 600$

$L = 30$ </center>

Knowing $L$ we solve for $K$:

<center> $K = 3.75(30)$

$K=112.5$ </center>

Lastly, we plug in our values of $L$ and $K$ to determine our total production:

<center> $6(30)^{.25}* (112.5)^{.75} = 485.06$</center>

And voila! Lagrange multipliers have helped us determine that 30 labor and 112.5 capital will achieve the optimized total production of 485.06.
