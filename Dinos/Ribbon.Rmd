&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How would you describe feathers? Soft, smooth, rigid, pointy, maybe irritable to the nose…what about ribbon-like?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s the description researchers have for the four tail feathers of the maniraptoran theropod Epidexipteryx, an Avialae loosely related to Archaeopteryx that was discovered in Inner Mongolia, China. Elongate and flowing, the feathers’ ribbon-like aspect has been referred to as a form of ornamentation, similar to the skull ornamentation found on Hadrosauria. To that extent, it remains unclear what purpose the ribbon-like feather characteristic served. Researchers note that elongate tail feathers help construct ornamental plumage for modern birds, whose length often correlates with courtship. The ribbon-like feathers of Epidexipteryx, then, may have been used to help attract mates, a solely aesthetic function. The ribbon-like feathers connected to a pygostyle-like structure in Epidexipteryx’s caudal vertebrae that formed the dinosaur’s small tail, an evolutionary trait that likely emphasized the display of the feathers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Epidexipteryx’s limbs lacked asymmetric pennaceous (quill-like) feathers that support flight, separating it from other basal theropods that had feathers to “pre-adapt” them for flight. These findings imply that Epidexipteryx could not glide either. Further, Epidexipteryx’s feathers were not suited for insulation. Even more interesting, Epidexipteryx stands as the oldest and most phylogenetically basal theropod known to feature feathers, implying that feathers may have originated as ornaments before facilitating gliding and flight. Researchers theorize this manifestation to have occurred in the middle to late Jurassic period.
