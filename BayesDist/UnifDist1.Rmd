The Uniform Distribution is a continuous distribution along a range of x-values. For the random variable $X$, the corresponding uniform density function $f(x)$ is defined along a range in which every value is equally likely (hence the name uniform). As such, no distribution models uncertainty better than the uniform. The Uniform Distribution of $X$ between a minimum and maximum x-value can be written as:

<center> $X \sim Unif(min,max)$</center>

whereby $X$ has the corresponding probability density function:

<center> $f(x) = \frac{1}{max-min}$ &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>for</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; $x\in(min,max)$</center>

Obviously, $min \ngeq max$.

The mean and variance for $X$ can be calculated as:

<center> $E(X)= \frac{1}{2}(a+b)$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b> and </b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $Var(X)=\frac{1}{12}(b-a)^2$</center>

Here, the x-axis, $min$, and $max$ each range from 0 to 1.
