The Uniform Distribution is a continuous distribution along a range of the domain, in which $f(x)$ has the same value (hence the name uniform). As such, no distribution models uncertainty better than the uniform. The Uniform Distribution of $X$ between a minimum and maximum value of the domain can be written as:

<center> $X \sim Unif(min,max)$</center>

Provided that:

<center> $f(x) = \frac{1}{max-min}$ &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>for</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; $x\in(min,max)$</center>

Here, the domain has been set from 0 to 1 while the $min$ and $max$ range from 0 to 2:
