The Exponential Distribution is ofted used to model waiting time before the occurrence of an event. As such, $X$ is often in units of time (e.g., seconds, minutes, etc.) and depends on the rate of the occurrence, represented by $\lambda$:

<center> $X \sim Exp(\lambda)$

$f(x|\lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>for</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; $x \geq 0$ &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>and</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; $\lambda > 0$ </center>

whereby:

<center> $E(X|\lambda) = \frac{1}{\lambda}$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b> and </b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $Var(X|\lambda)=\frac{1}{\lambda^2}$ </center>

Notice that both $E(X|\lambda)$ and $Var(X|\lambda)$ are inversely related to $\lambda$. As $\lambda$ increases, waiting time ($X$) decreases.

Here, the domain has been set from 0 to 5 while $\lambda$ ranges from 0 to 2.
