The Uniform Distribution is a continuous distribution along a range of the domain, in which $f(x)$ has the same value (hence the name uniform). The Uniform Distribution of $X$ between a minimum and maximum value of the domain can be written as:

<center> $X \sim Unif(min,max)$</center>

Provided that:

<center> $f(x) = \frac{1}{max-min}$ for $x\in(min,max)$</center>
