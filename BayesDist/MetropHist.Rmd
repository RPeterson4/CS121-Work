How does the distribution of acres that Ross worked on change as $n$ increases? Which $\sigma$ approximates the distribution with the smallest sample? Click "Show target density" to put the target density on the histogram.

We often don't have access to the target density because it's too complicated. But here, we can see that dependent samples from some distribution can approximate the target density!
