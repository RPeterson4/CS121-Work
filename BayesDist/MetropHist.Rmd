How does the distribution of acres that Ross worked on change as $n$ increases? Which $\sigma$ approximates the distribution with the fewest trials? Click "Show curve" to put the target density $P \sim Gamma (7.5, .15)$ on the histogram.

We often don't have access to the target density because it's too complicated. But here, we can see that dependent samples from some distribution can approximate the target density!
